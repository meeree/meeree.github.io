# Initial Academic Research

Before conducting any research myself on mixing biological techniques with game development, I first looked for relevant research on this topic. In particular, I looked for papers on three main high-level topics that I am considering: 
- Cellular auotomata and their uses in game dev., 
- Using and interacting with emergent behavior in video games, 
- And using Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) in video games to implement things like tree growth. 
1. I found the following papers after the initial search:
2. Using an emergent system concept in designing interactive games for autistic children
3. On the Music of Emergent Behavior: What Can Evolutionary Computation Bring to the Musician?
4. An evolutionary approach for interactive computer games
5. Adapting Bottom-up, Emergent Behaviour for Character-Based AI in Games
6. Cellular automata for real-time generation of infinite cave levels
7. Procedural maze level generation with evolutionary cellular automata
8. Probabilistic Cellular Automata for Granular Media in Video Games
9. Evolving Cellular Automata for Maze Generation
10. RESCALABLE, REPLAYABLE MAPS GENERATED WITH EVOLVED CELLULAR AUTOMATA
11. Using genetic algorithms to find cellular automata rule sets capable of generating maze-like game level layouts
12. The quantum game of life
13. Half-Real: Video Games between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds
14. Cellular Automata Machines: A New Environment for Modeling
15. MODELLING LAND USE LAND COVER CHANGES USING CELLULAR AUTOMATA IN A GEO-SPATIAL ENVIRONMENT
16. CityHeat: visualizing cellular automata-based traffic heat in Unity3D
17. New Games of Life: Cellular Automata and Subsurface Discourses in SimCity
18. Studying artificial life with cellular automata
19. GENERATING EMERGENT TEAM STRATEGIES IN FOOTBALL SIMULATION VIDEOGAMES VIA GENETIC ALGORITHMS 
20. L-systems: from the Theory to Visual Models of Plants
21. L systems (Western Ontario University)

From these papers I found the following three most interesting:
1. The Quantum Game of Life: 
- This paper develops a more complex version of the game of life that allows them to study quantum physics behavior. Cellular automata are a simple way to express complex phenomena, as demonstrated in this paper. 
2. L-systems: from the Theory to Visual Models of Plants
- This paper gives an overview of the concept of an L-System and goes into depth on how this system can be used to generate interesting procedural things in video games such as trees or fractals. Incidentally, I have used this paper in the past to implement my own parametric L-System: [GLS Project](https://github.com/meeree/GLS).
3. Procedural maze level generation with evolutionary cellular automata
- This paper outlines a method by which cellular automata can be used to generate mazes in video games. After looking around, this seems to be a relatively heavily researched topic.
