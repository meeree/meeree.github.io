<h1 id="initial-academic-research">Initial Academic Research</h1>

<p>Before conducting any research myself on mixing biological techniques with game development, I first looked for relevant research on this topic. In particular, I looked for papers on three main high-level topics that I am considering:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cellular auotomata and their uses in game dev.,</li>
  <li>Using and interacting with emergent behavior in video games,</li>
  <li>And using Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) in video games to implement things like tree growth.
    <ol>
      <li>I found the following papers after the initial search:</li>
      <li>Using an emergent system concept in designing interactive games for autistic children</li>
      <li>On the Music of Emergent Behavior: What Can Evolutionary Computation Bring to the Musician?</li>
      <li>An evolutionary approach for interactive computer games</li>
      <li>Adapting Bottom-up, Emergent Behaviour for Character-Based AI in Games</li>
      <li>Cellular automata for real-time generation of infinite cave levels</li>
      <li>Procedural maze level generation with evolutionary cellular automata</li>
      <li>Probabilistic Cellular Automata for Granular Media in Video Games</li>
      <li>Evolving Cellular Automata for Maze Generation</li>
      <li>RESCALABLE, REPLAYABLE MAPS GENERATED WITH EVOLVED CELLULAR AUTOMATA</li>
      <li>Using genetic algorithms to find cellular automata rule sets capable of generating maze-like game level layouts</li>
      <li>The quantum game of life</li>
      <li>Half-Real: Video Games between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds</li>
      <li>Cellular Automata Machines: A New Environment for Modeling</li>
      <li>MODELLING LAND USE LAND COVER CHANGES USING CELLULAR AUTOMATA IN A GEO-SPATIAL ENVIRONMENT</li>
      <li>CityHeat: visualizing cellular automata-based traffic heat in Unity3D</li>
      <li>New Games of Life: Cellular Automata and Subsurface Discourses in SimCity</li>
      <li>Studying artificial life with cellular automata</li>
      <li>GENERATING EMERGENT TEAM STRATEGIES IN FOOTBALL SIMULATION VIDEOGAMES VIA GENETIC ALGORITHMS</li>
      <li>L-systems: from the Theory to Visual Models of Plants</li>
      <li>L systems (Western Ontario University)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From these papers I found the following three most interesting:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Quantum Game of Life:
    <ul>
      <li>This paper develops a more complex version of the game of life that allows them to study quantum physics behavior. Cellular automata are a simple way to express complex phenomena, as demonstrated in this paper.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>L-systems: from the Theory to Visual Models of Plants
    <ul>
      <li>This paper gives an overview of the concept of an L-System and goes into depth on how this system can be used to generate interesting procedural things in video games such as trees or fractals. Incidentally, I have used this paper in the past to implement my own parametric L-System: <a href="https://github.com/meeree/GLS">GLS Project</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Procedural maze level generation with evolutionary cellular automata
    <ul>
      <li>This paper outlines a method by which cellular automata can be used to generate mazes in video games. After looking around, this seems to be a relatively heavily researched topic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
